		<h2 style="padding-bottom:0px;">Hi! Welcome to BREATHE!</h2>
		<h3>I am your chief editor and site author, Miss A! </h3>
		<div id="intro">BREATHE is a project to help spread mental health awareness, with a side job of aiding readers to share, relax, and enjoy their thoughts.<br><br>
		We post articles sharing people's thoughts about their experiences, and how the current stigma about mental health is tackled. We at BREATHE aim to soothe and become a 
		platform inviting people to hear out those voices of people that want to be heard, or those of sides that wish to express themselves with the help of words. <br><br>
		To be frank, this project first started as a requirement I'm supposed to finish. However, going through the process of establishing this website and scrolling through the Internet
		to find articles to share- I read the many stories of many people suffering from mental illnesses. These stories moved my heart, and made me look at their words with a renewed change of heart. <br><br>
		This is why we in BREATHE believe, that every single one of us have something to share. For those who are suffering with mental illnesses, 
		we wish to banish the negative stigma and discrimination that most of society paints them in. You who are reading this, don't feel as if you have made a grave mistake just you have a mental illness.
		It is not something to be ashamed of. You should even be proud. Because you fight with an internal war inside your mind. And not everyone can win against an army of invisible warriors.<br>
		<h3 style="text-align:center;">YOU ARE STRONGER THAN AVERAGE, AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE EMBARASSED ABOUT.</h3>
